            Recursion is the method of traversing through data structures by 
            making a function that does one simple traversal and then it calls 
            itself again and again until the base case is reached. The base case 
            is when the traversal should stop or when the data is found. 
            <br/><br/><i>
            A good way to think about recursion is by thinking about what 
            happens when you put a mirror in front of another mirror. One mirror
            will show the other mirror over and over until it is too small to
            see. In other words, the mirror is showing an image and then 
            repeating it's task. 
            </i><br/><br/>
            One data structure that benefits from recursion and can not easily
            be done with iteration would be a linked list. To find some data all
            that would need to be done is go to the next node (or specific node 
            if there is more than one) and check if it has the right data. If 
            not, go to the next one until the data is found or the end of the 
            list is reached. 
        </div>
        <h2>Iteration</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="img/iteration.png" alt="A circle with a few arrows 
            pointing to each other in a circle" title="Iteration" width="225">
        </figure>
        <div>
            <br/>
            Iteration is the method of traversing through data structures by 
            index. If the data structure has indices then the data in it can be
            randomly accessed and as long as the number of elements is known, 
            any element can be obtained.
            <br/><br/><i>
            Iteration is like finding the page of a book. You need to flip 
            through the book to find the page number. 
            </i><br/><br/>
            One data structure that works well with iteration is an array like 
            a vector. They are indexed so to navigate through them you need to
            go through the elements which is what iteration is for.
