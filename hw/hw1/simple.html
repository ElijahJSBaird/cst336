        <h2>Stack</h2>
        <img src="img/paperstack.png" width="200" alt="an image of a stack of papers in a box">
        <div>
            A stack is a data structure that follows a specific order to which 
            the operations are performed. The common terms for a stack are FILO 
            (First In Last Out) and LIFO (Last In First Out). These are common 
            terms because they describe how the stack behaves, the first item 
            that goes into a stack will be the last item out, or thinking about
            it backwards would show that the last thing to go into a stack is 
            the first to come out. Like a stack op paper in a box, to get the 
            last sheet you would need to pull out every other sheet first. This 
            also means that the last sheet you put into said box will be the 
            first one that is taken out.

        <h2>Queue</h2>
        <img src="img/queue.jpg" width="200" alt="an image of people standing in line">
        <div>
           A queue is similar to a stack because the items can only be added to 
           one end and removed from one end. The difference is that a queue is 
           FIFO (First In First Out) which means that the first thing to go in 
           will be the first to be removed. And the flipside is that the last 
           thing added is the last thing removed. A good real life example of 
           this would be waiting in line at a store. The first person to get in
           line is the first person to get to the register, and the last person
           in line is the last person to get to the register.

        <h2>Set</h2>
        <div>
            Sets are like arrays but can hold only unique elements. An element 
            cannot be added to a set if it already exists inside the set, and 
            it also cannot be modified. The element can, however, be removed and
            then added back in with the modified value. A set in real life would
            be like a collection of books, you won't buy a second copy of the
            exact same book, but if you sell, lose, or give away a book you can
            get another copy of the book that could be the same or an updated 
            version or a hardcover version instead.
