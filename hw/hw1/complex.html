        <h2>Linked List</h2>
        <img src="img/Linkedlist.png" width="450" alt="an image of a common blank visualization of a linked list">
        <div>
            This is a data structure that is a collection of elements which are 
            not contiguous memory locations. A linked list has no index and must
            be traversed by going to the next node. A node is what connects 
            elements together. A linked list is kind of like an online quiz 
            where you cannot access a random question and can only continue to
            the next question. Linked lists can be doubly linked which means 
            that the element has a forward and a backward node so the traversal
            can happen both ways instead of one.

        <h2>Map</h2>
        <!--<img src="img/binarytree.png" width="200">-->
        <div>
            Maps are associative containers since they are not indexed. Every 
            element has a key that is mapped to a value. The keys of a map are
            unique and therefore there can only be one of every key in a given 
            map. Unlike keys values are not unique, so there can be multiple 
            keys with the exact same value. A real life example would be an id
            number, there can be no duplicate id numbers, but there can be 
            multiple people with the same name. For instance, there can be a 
            Bob with the id number of 124870 and another Bob with an id number 
            of 312891.

        <h2>Tree</h2>
        <img src="img/binarytree.png" width="200" alt="an image of a tree data structure">
        <div>
            Trees are more complicated that the others due to the fact that they
            have hierarchy as opposed to linear or associative. Trees are like
            linked lists since they are held together by nodes and have no index
            so they need to be recursively traversed. The main difference is 
            that linked lists have a next node while trees have children nodes. 
            A binary tree has at most two nodes and there are more kinds of 
            trees for different applications. A good example of where trees 
            would be used would be computer files, your desktop can have 
            multiple files and folders, and each folder can have their own files
            and folders, so the hierarchy connects all of that data in a way 
            that makes it easy to navigate.
